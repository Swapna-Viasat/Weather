# 5Day_WeatherForecastAndroidApp

Introduction

This simple Android app uses the OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API to retrieve the current 5 day weather forecast.

Running and Building

This app was built with Android Studio Before building and running, please insert your own Open Weather Api key in strings.xml by altering the api_key String. Presently i have kept my Open Weather Api key

Testing

I tested the app on my Samsung Galaxy S8.

Tidying up

4 hours is not a long time to come up with something good. Stuff was thrown together quickly here. The following is a list of things that need cleaning up:

Strings are hardcoded
Comments are lacking
No error checking
Exceptions not handled correctly
Inconsistent variable naming
Tidy up code
Probably loads more...
More features with more time

Time ran out just when lots more features could be added such as:

Use a different View for each of the 5 days. At present all the days are just displayed in Listview.

Display far more data from the API such as wind, temperatures etc
Be able to dig down on a date to display even more info that won't fit on screen
Formatting is a thrown together mess - get this designed properly
Detect GPS and use that instead of hardcoding
Implement Navigation drawer, Settings etc
Implement nice error popups
tons more...
Third party libraries  not been used.Love to use Recycler View,Retrofit,Butterknife,Volley,Glide
